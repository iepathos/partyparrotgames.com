Save The Llama is a tower defense game with some unique mechanics for moving towers around for a puzzle-based spin on the genre.  The game is set in a western futuristic world where players must save their cows from invading alien UFOs.  Players must utilize rail systems, rotating cogs, and an array of different tower types to successfully defend their cows.  Specializations can be unlocked as players defeat levels and gather achievements to improve their various towers' performance.  Some of the levels are extremely challenging.
