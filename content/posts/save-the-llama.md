Save The Llama is new tower defense game being developed by Moonshot Monkey.  What makes the game unique from other tower defense games other than art style is an array of "mechanisms" which allow players to control movement of their towers around the map.  We'll post more information and some previews as we move closer to release.  The expected release date for STL is December 2021.
